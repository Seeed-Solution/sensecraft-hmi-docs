## Introduction

The Gallery function in [SenseCraft HMI](https://sensecraft.seeed.cc/hmi) allows you to transform your screen-based devices into beautiful digital photo frames. You can upload local images or import them from URLs, then display them with customizable transition intervals and visual effects. This feature is perfect for creating ambient displays, information screens, or decorative photo albums using your Seeed Studio display devices.

This tutorial will guide you through using the Gallery function in SenseCraft HMI, covering image upload methods, display settings, and important considerations for optimal performance.

## Managing Your Gallery

### Setting Display Interval

The interval setting determines how long each image is displayed before transitioning to the next one:

Step 1. Locate the "Interval(min):" field in the control panel

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/71.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Step 2. Enter your desired display time in minutes (e.g., 1 for one minute per image)

### Choosing Dither Mode

The dither mode affects how images are processed for optimal display on your specific device:

Step 1. Find the "Dither Mode:" dropdown in the control panel

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/72.png" style={{width:600, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Step 2. Select the appropriate option for your device:

- **Full Color**: Best for color LCD displays, preserves all color information

- **Black and White**: Converts images to pure black and white, ideal for monochrome e-paper displays

:::tip
For e-paper/e-ink displays, select "Black and White" mode for optimal display quality and faster refresh rates. For LCD screens, "Full Color" will provide the best visual experience.
:::

### Using the Image Toolbar

Each image in your gallery can be adjusted using the toolbar that appears above the image:

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/73.png" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

From left to right, the tools are:

1. **Fill Horizontally**: Adjusts the image to fill the screen horizontally while maintaining aspect ratio

2. **Fill Vertically**: Adjusts the image to fill the screen vertically while maintaining aspect ratio

3. **Download**: Save the processed image to your computer

4. **Delete**: Remove the image from your gallery

:::tip
Use the "Fill Horizontally" option for landscape images and "Fill Vertically" for portrait images to make the best use of your display space while avoiding image distortion.
:::

### Reordering Images

You can change the display order of your images using the thumbnail strip:

Step 1. Locate the image thumbnail you want to move in the strip at the bottom of the screen

Step 2. Click and drag the thumbnail to a new position in the sequence

Step 3. Release to set the new order

## Deploying Your Gallery to Your Device

Once you've added and configured your images, you can deploy the gallery to your connected device:

Step 1. Click the "Save" button to store your gallery configuration

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/74.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

:::tip
After uploading or designing an image, habitually click the save button to ensure your layout design won't be easily lost.
:::

Step 2. (Optional) Click "Preview" to see how your gallery will appear on the device without fully deploying it

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/75.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Step 3. Click "Deploy" to send your gallery to the connected device

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/76.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Step 4. Wait for the deployment confirmation message

:::tip
After clicking the deploy button, the device may not update the album immediately. The device might be in sleep mode. It will pull the latest album images when it wakes up next time. If you want to update the photos immediately, you can click the green button above the device, and the device will wake up instantly and pull the dashboard updates.
:::

After deployment, your device will begin displaying the images according to your interval setting.

## Storage Considerations

### MicroSD Card Requirements

To store more than 3 images on your device, you'll need to use a MicroSD card:

1. **Format**: The MicroSD card must be formatted as FAT32

2. **Size**: 8GB or larger recommended (up to 32GB supported)

3. **Speed**: Class 10 or higher recommended for better performance

:::warning
Using file systems other than FAT32 may result in the device not recognizing the MicroSD card or failing to save images properly.
:::

### How to Format a MicroSD Card as FAT32

## Optimizing Images for Your Display

For the best visual results on your device's display:

1. **Match the resolution**: Prepare images that match your device's native resolution (typically 800x480 pixels)

2. **Consider aspect ratio**: Use images with a 5:3 aspect ratio to avoid white padding

3. **Optimize for display type**:

- For color LCD: Standard color images work well
- For e-paper/e-ink: Higher contrast images with fewer color gradients
- For 2-color e-paper: Black and white or high contrast images

4. **File size**: Keep images under 2MB to avoid automatic compression

5. **Brightness/contrast**: Adjust based on your specific display's characteristics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Images not uploading**:

- Check that your image is in a supported format (JPG, PNG, GIF)

- Ensure the file size is not too large (ideally under 2MB)

- Try a different browser or clear your browser cache

2. **Cannot upload more than 3 images**:

- Verify that you have a properly formatted MicroSD card inserted in your device

- Check that the MicroSD card is formatted as FAT32

- Ensure the device is properly detecting the MicroSD card

3. **Images display incorrectly**:

- Adjust the brightness/contrast using the image toolbar

- Prepare images that match your device's resolution

4. **Deployment fails**:

- Ensure your device is properly connected to SenseCraft HMI

- Check that your device has sufficient storage space
  
- Restart your device and try deploying again
