### Creating Images with AI in Gallery

Step 1. In the AI Generator panel, you'll see a text input field with a prompt like "Describe the image you want to generate..."

Step 2. Enter a detailed description of the image you want to create. For example:

- "A beautiful mountain landscape with a sunrise and pine trees"

- "A minimalist dashboard showing temperature and humidity icons"

- "A circuit board pattern with Seeed Studio logo in the center"

Step 3. Click the "Generate" button (magic wand icon) to start the image generation process

Step 4. Wait while the AI processes your request. This typically takes 10-30 seconds depending on the complexity of your description.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/58.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Step 5. Once completed, click the "Add to Gallery" button, and the AI-generated image will appear in your gallery

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/59.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Refining AI-Generated Gallery Images

After generating an image, you can refine it through conversation with the AI:

Step 1. If you're not satisfied with the result, you can provide feedback directly in the AI Generator panel. For example:

- "Make the colors more vibrant"

- "Add more contrast to the image"

- "Change the background to blue"

Step 2. Click "Generate" again to create a new version based on your feedback

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/60.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Step 3. Continue this iterative process until you're satisfied with the result

## AI Generation in Canvas

The Canvas AI Generation is more powerful, allowing you to create complete interactive interfaces with functional components.

### Accessing Canvas AI Generation

Step 1. Click on the "Canvas" tab in the left sidebar

Step 2. Notice the AI Generator panel on the right side of the screen, similar to the one in Gallery

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/reterminal_e10xx/img/61.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Creating Interfaces with AI in Canvas

Step 1. In the AI Generator panel, enter a description of the interface you want to create. Be specific about the components you need. For example:

- "Create a weather dashboard with temperature display, humidity gauge, and forecast icons"

- "Design a smart home control panel with buttons for lights, thermostat, and security"

- "Make a fitness tracker interface with step counter, heart rate display, and activity history"

Step 2. Click the "Generate" button to start the interface generation process

Step 3. Wait while the AI processes your request and creates the interface layout

Step 4. Once complete, the AI will place various components on your Canvas according to your description

## Best Practices for AI Generation

To get the most out of the AI Generation feature, follow these tips:

### Tips for Effective Prompts

1. **Be specific**: Instead of "Create a dashboard," try "Create a dashboard with temperature display in the center, humidity on the right, and a clock at the top"

2. **Mention colors and style**: "Use a blue and white color scheme with rounded corners for all elements"

3. **Reference familiar designs**: "Make it look like a smart thermostat interface" or "Design it similar to a fitness tracker display"

### Iterative Refinement

The most successful designs often come from multiple rounds of feedback:

1. Start with a general description

2. Generate the initial design

3. Provide specific feedback on what to change

4. Generate an updated version

5. Repeat until satisfied

### Combining AI Generation with Manual Editing

For the best results:

1. Use AI to quickly create the basic layout and components

2. Manually fine-tune the positioning, sizing, and properties of individual elements

3. Add any custom functionality or data bindings manually

4. Use AI again if you want to add new sections or make major changes
